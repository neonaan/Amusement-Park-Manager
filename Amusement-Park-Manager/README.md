CPSC 304
## Relational Database Project

#### Design
We designed a relational database that can be useful to amusement park businesses. We modelled these conceptual relations with an ER diagram, created relevant functional dependencies, and wrote SQL DDL pertaining to the BCNF-normalized relations.

#### Implementation
We worked with Oracle for the database management system, PHP for the backend, and HTML/CSS for the frontend. We also used both SQL*Plus and the DataGrip IDE to view our data.

#### Future
We plan to improve the functionality and user experience/interface beyond this course.
